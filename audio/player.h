// The seam from the wire to the speaker: s2c 0x006d -> resource -> decoded clip -> mixer -> sink.
//
//   0x006d ResID -> ordinal into the concatenated 0x000e availability list -> content id -> the fetched file bytes
//
// 0x006d is decoded in proto/dec_s2c_006d_sound.cpp; this file parses it again into typed fields. Resolution:
// - A play can arrive before its file, because the resource channel is one serial queue. A play whose bytes are missing
//   is held (see kPendingTtlMs) and its resource moves to the front of the declaration queue.
// - The ordinal is re-resolved on every retry, since the 0x000e list can still be growing.
// - The kind byte is not used to filter plays.
// - The decoded-clip cache is bounded at 64 MB.
//
// Threads: SoundFeed lives on the session thread (it needs the model's resource list and the pump's store). Player owns
// a decoder thread, so a long Ogg decode never stalls the mix, and an output thread that renders and writes, paced by
// the sink or the wall clock. Neither touches the model or the socket.
