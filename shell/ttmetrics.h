// ttmetrics: the TrueType half of render/dsmaptext.h (MeasureText), on Qt's font stack.
//
// Stock DreamSeeker measures a TrueType family with GDI: CreateFont(lfHeight = -em), per-character advances, and
// tmAscent and tmDescent. The advances match the hinted advances QFontMetrics::horizontalAdvance returns for the same
// font file at pixel size em, and for the Microsoft core fonts GDI's C width matches QFontMetrics::rightBearing (the
// overhang an aligned line counts; metric-compatible stand-ins differ for a few glyphs). tmAscent and tmDescent come from the font's VDMX table for that ppem, which Qt does not
// use, so they are read from the table here, falling back to Qt's ascent and descent when there is none.
// A family the host lacks returns false, and dsmaptext then asks for Arial, as stock does when a family is missing.
// Liberation Sans, Serif and Mono stand in for Arial, Times New Roman and Courier New. They have the same advances
// but no VDMX table, so on a Liberation-only host the MeasureText width matches stock and the height may be a pixel
// short.
