// FocusFilter: the app-level key router.
//   map / output / info focused -> every key goes to macro routing
//   input focused               -> the key's own binding fires unless the text field takes the key (inputBarFires
//                                  in focusfilter.cpp), and Any fires only for keys that neither type nor edit
//   browser focused             -> the page owns its keys (the filter never touches them)
// A matched macro is emitted as macroFired(), an Any macro first; the app routes its command (app/inputrouter: client
// commands such as `.north`, `.winset` macro-set swaps, and everything else as a command line for the session). A key
// no macro binds does nothing, arrows included: stock DreamSeeker walks only through a binding, such as the default
// skin's `NORTH+REP` = `.north`.
//
// Reroute guard: the filter never reposts a key. It dispatches directly, acts only on the event delivered to the
// focus widget (so the window-to-widget double delivery is handled once), and ignores keys that arrive while it is
// dispatching (inDispatch_).
