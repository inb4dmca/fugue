// Resource pump: the 0x000e availability list, 0x003c declarations, 0x009f offer/pull/data, reassembly, decipher,
// VERIFY-by-resID, and a content-addressed on-disk store.
//
// The pump must answer from the first frame. DreamDaemon's resource channel is a per-connection serial queue advanced
// by the client's pull, and one unanswered 0x9f offer wedges it for the rest of the session. So onFrame() answers every
// offer immediately, solicited or not, before any slow work.
//
// Not thread-safe; one owner (the session's reader thread). It blocks on nothing but local disk I/O. Sends go through
// the Send callback on the same thread.
//
// Message layout: offer/pull/data (0x9f), availability list (0x000e), declarations (0x003c); cipher and resID are as in
// resource.h. Offers are matched to declarations by content (respump.cpp). A layout disagreement with stock surfaces as
// an unverified resource, never as accepted bytes.
