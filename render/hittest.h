// The mouse hit test: viewport pixel -> the ATOM under the cursor, and that atom's mouse-command naming (over-ref, loc,
// icon-x/y, screen-loc).
//
// The hit test reads the same placed layers the compositor draws. scene.cpp's Assembler records, in draw order, every
// sprite it placed together with the atom that owns it (HitScene::world), and the HUD passes with their screen_loc
// destinations. Nothing here re-derives a position, plane or layer, so the hit test cannot drift from the pixels.
// Collection is additive: the DrawList the executor consumes is byte-identical with or without it.
//
// Rules, as stock DreamSeeker 516 applies them:
//   mouse_opacity 0   the atom is skipped entirely, overlays included (an overlay's own value is ignored).
//   mouse_opacity 1   (default) a target only where the source sprite pixel's alpha is not 0. atom.alpha, colour and
//                     tint are not part of the test.
//   mouse_opacity 2   a target over the sprite's whole rectangle, transparent pixels included.
//   draw order        topmost drawn wins: planes ascending, then the draw key (drawKey, per layer), then creation order
//                     (the order of HitScene::world). An overlay answers for its parent atom.
//   HUD               client.screen layers are hit-tested in the order they are drawn, each overlay by its own plane and
//                     key, then client.screen order (later on top). A screen layer's key sits above every map layer of
//                     its plane and band, whatever the layers, and below every map layer of a higher plane or band. So a
//                     mouse_opacity 2 HUD
//                     item takes its whole rectangle over the slot background beneath it, and over the map beneath its
//                     plane. The full-screen click catcher (mouse_opacity 2 on plane -99) answers only where no map layer
//                     of plane >= -99 covers the pixel. An item at layer 2 over its background at layer 1 answers at a pixel
//                     the background paints, whichever joined client.screen first; a background at the higher layer still
//                     answers where it paints and the item's rectangle where it does not; at equal layers the later one
//                     is on top; plane beats layer. A HUD atom's location is NULL.
//   nothing covers    no hit, so no mouse frame at all.
//   icon-x/icon-y     relative to the named atom's own icon frame (HitFrame), 1-based, with icon-y counting up from the
//                     bottom row. Through an atom.transform the cursor is mapped back into the untransformed icon. Over an
//                     overlay it is still the atom's frame and is not clamped.
//   vis-x/vis-y       the cursor within the bounding box of the transformed icon (centred on the icon's centre plus the
//                     translation, half extents floored), sent only when it differs from icon-x/icon-y: for a scale, rotate,
//                     flip or skew, never for a pure translation, a pixel offset or an overlay, and never when either half
//                     is the 0x8000 "unset" value. Sub-pixel rule (hittest.cpp frameCoords): the cursor is the pixel's
//                     top-left corner and every coordinate is floored in +y-down image space. So Turn(90) gives
//                     vis-x = icon-y + 1, vis-y = 33 - icon-x, and its leftmost box column (icon-y 0) is not the atom: the
//                     turf beneath answers.
//   vis_contents      a child is named itself, in its own frame (a child at pixel_x 16 has icon-x 23), at its holder's cell (a
//                     map atom shown in another atom's vis_contents is located at the holder, not its own loc). It is drawn
//                     and named through the holder's transform about its own centre.
//   location          the named atom's own cell, not the cursor's.
//   plane master      a PLANE_MASTER at mouse_opacity 0 hides everything drawn on its plane (per placed layer: an
//                     overlay on that plane drops out, while its atom's own icon on another plane still answers). The
//                     layers never reach HitScene::world (scene.cpp MasterRec::hideFromMouse). A master at
//                     mouse_opacity 2 (takes every click off its plane) is not modelled.
//   maptext           never takes a click by its ink. An obj's own maptext, or a client.image's, answers with the turf
//                     beneath at mouse_opacity 1. At the atom's mouse_opacity 2 its whole maptext box is part of its
//                     rectangle. A maptext link (<a href>) is not modelled.
//   client.images     an image's pixels answer for its parent (HitAtom = the parent's: its name, location and
//                     mouse_opacity; the image's own mouse_opacity and alpha are ignored), named in the image's own icon
//                     frame. An override image replaces the parent's shape (scene.cpp imagesOn).
//   render_source     a relay of an atom's render_target is such an image: it answers for its parent where the relayed
//                     pixels paint. With PASS_MOUSE on the relay they answer for the SOURCE atom instead (a client.screen
//                     source: located nowhere), named in the source's icon frame at the relay, where their alpha is not 0
//                     whatever the relay's or the source's mouse_opacity. vis-x/vis-y then count from a client.screen
//                     source's screen_loc, its pixel_x/pixel_y left out (HitFrame::visLeft/visBottom), and are sent when
//                     they differ from icon-x/icon-y.
//                     PASS_MOUSE without render_source changes nothing.
//
// The draw key (drawKey), as stock DreamSeeker 516 sorts its map icon list: plane, then a sub-layer byte, then a float
// layer, then the order the icons were listed. A MAP layer's layer is first lowered by its view cell's tie-break,
// (32*y + x + 33) / 2^18 for the 1-based cell x,y from the view's bottom-left, in float32: at the same layer a lower row
// draws over a higher one and a cell over the one east of it, and a layer just at a threshold can round below it: 5000
// always does, 20000 and 25000 from the 7th row up (where the tie-break passes half a float step). Then, from
// the float: at 20000 or more, 20000 off and the byte -64 (BACKGROUND_LAYER); then at 5000 or more, 5000 off and +16
// (EFFECTS_LAYER, also within the background). A client.screen layer has no tie-break and +1, so it sits above every
// map layer of its band and below the next band. TOPDOWN_LAYER is no band on a topdown map; a negative layer is regular.
// Not modelled (the scene stats count these): a plane master's mouse_opacity 2,
// its rule for client.screen objects on its plane, slate/relay folding, maptext links (<a href>),
// animated appearances' mid-tween positions, and an image on a parent at mouse_opacity 2 (whether the image's rectangle
// joins the parent's).
// A HUD object is hit over everything it draws: a sprite larger than a tile, its pixel offsets and its attached client.images
// are not clipped to the screen_loc cell. icon-x/icon-y count from the atom's own icon, so an overlay drawn 24 px east of it
// answers icon-x 25..56.
