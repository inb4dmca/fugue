// dsmaptext: client.MeasureText() answered the way stock DreamSeeker 516 answers it (s2c/c2s 0x00fc).
//
// What DreamSeeker does:
//   * Text is laid out with GDI fonts: CreateFont(lfHeight = -em), then the face's per-character advance widths
//     (GetTextExtentPoint: a plain sum, no kerning) and GetTextMetrics' tmHeight/tmAscent. A CSS size N (px is treated
//     as pt) is rounded to integer pt, em = round(N*4/3), except that pt 9 measures as em 13 (it is drawn at em 12).
//   * Faces: no font-family (or `sans-serif`) gives "MS Sans Serif" 10pt, a bitmap font (sserife.fon: 8/10/12pt).
//     "Small Fonts" has one 7pt strike, so under the Wine profile every size up to 13pt measures alike. `monospace`, <tt>, <code>
//     and <pre> give the "Courier" bitmap. Any other family is that TrueType face; an unknown one falls back to Arial.
//     A bitmap face is integer-scaled above its largest strike (k = (em + 2*il) / tmHeight).
//   * Lines: tmHeight for the last line, and floor(line-height * tmAscent) between lines. line-height defaults to 1.2
//     and accepts only a number or a percentage; `normal` or a length stacks every line at pitch 0. Bold on a bitmap
//     face adds 1 px per character; italic adds nothing.
//   * Width: with a width argument (> 0) the reply's width is that argument; with 0, it is the widest line (a trailing
//     run of n spaces counts n-1 of them). Wrapping is greedy at spaces, tabs and &nbsp;, and after '-' (not '/'). A
//     word wider than the whole width is cut by character.
//   * The style sheet is the default map control's `style` followed by the call's own `style`: `.class` rules apply in
//     stylesheet order, and `body` styles the base. The first declaration of a property
//     wins; `font:` sets family, size, weight and style together, defaulting what it omits.
//   * "" gives DreamSeeker's "cannot measure" (the server resumes with null); whitespace or tags only gives height 0.
//
// Two profiles, because Windows and wine ship different bitmap fonts. The Windows profile (the default) has Small Fonts
// 5pt and 6pt strikes, with estimated advance widths; the Wine profile has only the 7pt strike.
//
// Not modelled: lines that mix font sizes, <IMG> (measures 0), <h1>-<h6>, text-indent, padding and letter-spacing.
// TrueType faces need setTrueTypeResolver(); without one they measure as MS Sans Serif.
