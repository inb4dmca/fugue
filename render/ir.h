// Draw-list IR and its CPU executor. The assembler (scene.cpp) resolves every world-dependent decision into a
// DrawList; the executor is a pure function of the list.

// Order is data: planes ascend, layers inside a plane are in draw order (the assembler owns the sort), and HUD
// passes are in client.screen arrival order.

//   DrawList
//     outW x outH       the map control's pixel size
//     planes[]          ascending plane id. Each PlanePass composites its layers onto a fresh transparent surface,
//                       which is then blended over the frame. One surface per plane matters: flattening per plane
//                       rounds differently from compositing every layer onto the frame.
//                       A PLANE_MASTER turns the finished surface into an off-screen slate or a filtered, coloured,
//                       blended plane (group -> filters -> colour -> blend), in two passes: pass 1 fills the
//                       render-target slates, pass 2 builds the scene.
//     hud[]             HudPass, after all planes. Each composites onto a transparent canvas that holds the whole
//                       object (its screen_loc cell joined with every layer's rectangle), then blits it at every dest.
//                       The map assembler does not emit it: screen objects are placed on their planes.
//     groundBlack       the final flatten onto the opaque black ground, so alpha is 255 everywhere.
//
//   Layer: a borrowed immutable straight-alpha sprite (or a RELAY naming a slate), a top-left (x,y) that may be
//   negative or run off the edge (the executor clips), a tint, an alpha, an optional colour matrix and a blend mode.
//
// Rounding (see executor.cpp):
//   1. tint/alpha: clamp8(float64(c) * (mul/255.0)), with clamp8(v) = uint8(v + 0.5) for 0 < v < 255.
//   2. layer over surface: float64 straight-alpha over, with the sa==0 / sa==255 shortcuts of blendLayer (pixops.cpp).
//   3. blit Over: 16-bit premultiplied arithmetic (HUD tiles, and the final black flatten).
