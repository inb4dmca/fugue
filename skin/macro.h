// skin/macro.h - `.dmf` macro specs and macro sets (the keybind tables).
//
// The DM Reference "macros (skin)" entry: the macro `name` is a key combination as it would appear in the macro editor,
//   such as CTRL+E, Space+REP or Alt+Shift+F1. It is not case-specific and modifiers may go anywhere, so the spec is
//   parsed into a set rather than string-compared. A space separates tokens as `+` does. `+REP` repeats while held; `+UP` fires on release; `Any` matches any
//   key, and UP is its only documented modifier.
// `Any` fires for every key press, modifier keys included, before the key's own binding. Of the Any specs whose
//   modifiers are all held, the one with the most wins, Alt before Ctrl before Shift; Any+REP answers a press like Any
//   and never repeats. A release fires plain Any+UP whatever is held, and an Any+UP with modifiers never fires.
// Real skins bind both `F2` and `F2+REP` (baystation12), and `WEST` and `WEST+UP` (vg). So +REP and +UP are part of a
//   binding's identity, not flags on one binding.
// A key's own binding falls back to fewer modifiers in the same order; the first combination with an enabled binding
//   claims the key. Its non-REP binding answers a press (else its REP one), and the hold repeats only if that
//   combination has an enabled REP binding. Each repeat runs the first REP binding the modifiers held then reach. A
//   release looks up the +UP bindings the same way, by the modifiers held at the press.
// A modifier key (SHIFT, CTRL, ALT) matches only its bare binding, so a spec such as `CTRL+SHIFT` never fires.
// Not stated by any document: an all-modifier spec (vg's `CTRL+SHIFT`) reads its last modifier as the key; a second key
//   token is dropped; the aliases ENTER, ESC, BACKSPACE/BKSP, INS and DEL fold to RETURN, ESCAPE, BACK, INSERT and
//   DELETE; the key is upper-cased.
