// DreamSeeker's command line as dreamseeker.exe 516.1684 parses it, so fugue-qt can stand in for it: a pager, a byond://
// handler, or `dreamseeker "byond://host:port" -pager` gets the same result from Fugue.
// Matches stock DreamSeeker 516.1684:
//   * A '-' argument is matched case-insensitively against -trace, -pager, -trusted, -safe, -ultrasafe, -isserver and
//     -is-server; -debug is case-sensitive. Any other '-' argument is dropped and is never the target. The self-updater
//     forms ({-install a b c}, {-updated}) act only in a standalone hub-game build; in stock dreamseeker.exe they are
//     ordinary unknown flags.
//   * A '+' argument swallows the next one. Only the exact `+connect` uses it, and only when another argument follows its value.
//     Its value is the target, with "byond://" prepended unless already present. A later +connect replaces the target.
//   * Anything else is the target if none is set yet (stored raw), else it is dropped.
//   * -trusted / -safe / -ultrasafe set one field: the last one wins.
// Fugue's own options (`--name`, `--name=value`, `--name value` for a value-taking name) are not DreamSeeker's. Invoked as
// DreamSeeker, an unknown `--word` is dropped as DS drops an unknown '-' argument; as fugue-qt it goes to Fugue's parser.
// Qt's own arguments are removed by QApplication before Fugue reads argv, but DreamSeeker counts them: they are passed in
// `hostTaken`, so DS's argc and indices stay DS's.
